        "Appearance": "The Himalayan Giant Honeybee, or Apis laboriosa, earns its name with its large size compared to other honeybee species. These bees typically measure around 17 to 20 millimeters in length and have distinctive dark brown to black coloration. They are easily recognizable by their robust build and loud buzzing flight.",
        "Habitat": "Apis laboriosa is native to the Himalayan region, where it inhabits rugged mountainous terrain at high altitudes. They construct their large, single-comb nests on cliff faces or rocky overhangs, often at altitudes exceeding 2,500 meters.",
        "Behavior": "Himalayan Giant Honeybees exhibit highly social behavior, living in colonies consisting of a queen, drones, and worker bees. They are known for their remarkable ability to withstand cold temperatures and forage at high altitudes, making them well-adapted to their mountainous habitat.",

Despite their small stature, Apis florea possesses the same general body structure as other honeybees, including wings and specialized mouthparts for collecting nectar and pollen.",
        "Habitat": "Apis florea is native to regions of South and Southeast Asia, where it thrives in warm climates with abundant floral resources. These bees are well-adapted to a variety of habitats, including tropical forests, savannas, and agricultural landscapes. They construct small, exposed nests in protected locations, such as tree branches, rock crevices, or human-made structures, where they build intricate honeycomb structures to rear their young.",
        "Behavior": "The behavior of Apis florea is characterized by its social structure and foraging habits. Like other honeybee species, Apis florea lives in colonies consisting of a queen, drones, and worker bees. These bees exhibit remarkable cooperation and communication within their colonies, working together to gather nectar and pollen, care for the brood, and defend their nest from potential threats. Apis florea is also known for its swarming behavior, during which a colony splits to establish a new nest site.",
